🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I’m thrilled to present my newly developed Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Team of the Week Dashboard, built entirely using Python! ⚽️🐍

In the world of FPL, staying on top of player performance is key to outsmarting the competition. With this in mind, I’ve created a dynamic dashboard that:

🔍 Analyzes weekly player data to identify the top performers
📊 Visualizes key statistics and insights using powerful Python libraries
📈 Tracks player performance trends to help you make informed decisions

Key Features:
Automated Data Fetching: Using APIs to get the latest FPL data.
Data Processing: Cleaned and processed data using Pandas.
Interactive Visualizations: Created with Matplotlib and Seaborn for a comprehensive view.
User-Friendly Interface: Implemented with Dash and Plotly for an interactive experience.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Why This Matters:
For FPL enthusiasts, having quick access to detailed performance insights can make a significant difference in planning your team strategy. My dashboard simplifies this by presenting all the essential data in one place, enabling quick and effective decision-making.
